    <p>Loved by many, but also <em>hated</em> by many. From my family, only my father in law likes this - and ofcourse my Uzbek side of the family</p>
    <p>The recipe is far from simple, but I gurantee you that it is unlike anything you have ever tried before. It is on par with some Danish foods. Imagine a cold soup, <em>wait..</em> <strong> who even thought it is a good idea??</strong></p>
