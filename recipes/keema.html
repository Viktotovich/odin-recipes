    <h1>Keema Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/keema.webp" alt = "a picture of keema">
    <p>Keema is a very famous Indian dish that I just happened to stumble upon in UAE. It was 3 AM at night in Ras Al Khaimah, we were hungry - there was no food or cafeterias anywhere around - and I had just finished my shift hours ago without having dinner. </p>
    <p>I look at Google maps, scrolling and scrolling. Nada. <em>Until..</em></p>
    <p>We found a small Indian cafeteria that is still open - and that is how we got to know about keema</p>
    <p>It could've been the hunger, but it was the best keema we had ever tried</p>
<h2>What do I need to make it?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Minced meta </li>
    <li>Purple onions</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Tumeric</li>
    <li>Green peas</li>
    <li>Tomato Paste</li>
</ul>
<p>While keema is not as simple as salsa, it is still quite easy to make. There are many variations to it, but this is the one that we have come to like the most</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Dice the onions and garlic</li>
    <li>Cook the onions and garlic in low heat</li>
    <li>Add a little but of sugar, salt (to taste), tumeric, black pepper, and other spices as per preference</li>
    <li>Once the onions turn yellow-ish, add the minced meat</li>
    <li>Once meat is brown, add the tomato paste</li>
    <li>Add 2 spoonfulls of water, to add moisture</li>
    <li>After adding the moisture, add the green peas and cook for another 3 minutes</li>
    <li>And done! You have your authentic keema!</li>
</ol>
<p>Keema is usually eaten with poratha, but can practically be used with anything. You could even add it to macaronis to make it "Macaron po flotskii". Keema is super versatile and enyable to prepare.</p>
